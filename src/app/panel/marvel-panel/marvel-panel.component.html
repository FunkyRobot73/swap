      MARVEL Comics...  Marvel has taken the world by storm.
    </p>
    <p>I'm a DC guy so when ever I've bought or read a MARVEL comic it was like I was cheating on DC.  I get it.  Marvel is great.  The characters are great but...  DC is better.  I've had a few obsessions over the years:

      <li>Comics</li>
      <li>Star Trek (and most Science Fiction)</li>
      <li>Video Games (but mainly getting any game running on my emulator)</li>

      I've been buying comics since the early 1980s.  I don't remember the first comic book I had but I do remember some of the first I ever owned.  I had a few variety stores in the neighbourhood and they'd have a bunch on magazine racks and I remember buying a lot of DC Comics and esp. Justice League books.  I specifically remember the cover of #190 with Starro the Conquerer, Action Comics #488, Batman & the Outsiders #1 and Transformers #5.

      I had a friend that collected Firestorm.  He had several of them and just kept them.  I guess that's when I started to treat them well and collect them too.  I remember having about 20 or 30 of them but one day I traded them for a Transformer toy called Blaster.  I might have gotten the short end of the stick there.

    At some point I stopped collecting but then I saw an article in the newspaper about Crisis on Infinite Earths.  DC Comics had killed off The Flash & Supergirl.  I was back in.

    I remember I once sold a big chunk of my collection when I was 18.  I've regretted doing that for a long time but I'm turning 50 this year and baby needs to go to college.  Eventually.
